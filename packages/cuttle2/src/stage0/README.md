# wcutil (work-in-progress)

This is the first stage (of many) that incrementally improves the way we write web components.

We want to make a web component that is easy to use, intuitive, and compileable (more on this later).

Firstly, this utility is to HELP you write web components, not to enforce conventions, code styles, etc. And as such, it should be designed to strictly follow the [web component specifications](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements), but be permissive with its use.

Second, we need to understand how web components are used. In this stage, we create a web component using vanilla JavaScript. We do use some [best-practices](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/best-practices) as put forth by the Google people.
