# Cuttle
A tiny helper for creating Web Components.

- The file itself is smaller than ~3KB!
- Can be transformed to become a zero-cost abstraction (with `cuttle-cli` or `babel-plugin-transform-cuttle`)!
- Supports UMD, CJS, and ESM!

## Features
- A small footprint.
- Compatible with Angular, Vue.js, and any other framework that works with native web components.
- Crafted to satisfy the web component specifications.
- Let's you override existing web components, unlike other frameworks such as `lit-html` or `slim.js`. So feel free to extend HTMLButtonElement!
- Doesn't care about your backplate. It's just properties. Use `redux` or whatever you prefer.
- Has multiple ways to do things to match your code style.
- Automatically parses attributes to any type when you use it.
- Use what you learn or already know about native Web Components! Simple and reusable.
